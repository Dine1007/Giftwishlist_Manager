### User Story

Sarah is turning 30. She does not want to dictate to everybody on what to purchase but she wants useful gifts. She goes to Gift Wishlist Manager and Register and adds her name, email and password and her account is created. She is now logged in.
She hits the button Create Wishlist and calls it Sarah 30th Birthday. Then she clicks on Add Item and enters two items she desires Sony Headphones at a cost of 350 and The Alchemist book at a cost of 15. She even later on realizes that the price of the headphones has been lowered to $320 and as such, she clicks on Edit Item and changes the price. She also put in a yoga mat accidentally and so she clicks Delete Item and deletes it.
Her list is ready. She clicks Share Wishlist and pastes the individual link which the system provides. She forwards it to her WhatsApp friends.
Tom is given the connection and he taps. The app is able to do this without asking Tom to log in. He is in a position to view the items and their prices. He makes a purchase decision and clicks Reserve. Reservation requires an account which he registers and then logs in. The headphones have taken the label of Reserved. They are recorded as unavailable by other visitors. Sarah makes her own list and even considers it available, so there is no danger in her surprise.
Later on, Tom reverses his mind and clicks Un-reserve Item. The headphones become available again. His friend Jake(other guest) opens the connection and realizes that the headphones are free and books them instead.
Having purchased the headphones in the store Jake opens the app and presses Mark as Purchased. It has permanently shut down.
During Sarah's birthday she gets what she wanted without any duplicates and spoilt surprises.
